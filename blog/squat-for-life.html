        The squat isn't just a gym exercise—it's a fundamental human movement pattern that determines your quality of life as you age. Learn the mechanics, common breakdowns, and corrective strategies to keep you squatting pain-free for decades.
      </div>

      <div class="epc-blog-section">
        <p class="epc-blog-text">
          Every time you sit down, stand up, pick something off the floor, or get out of your car, you're performing a squat. It's one of the most essential movement patterns in human function—and one of the most commonly broken. At Elite Performance Clinic, we see the consequences of poor squatting mechanics daily: knee pain, low back strain, hip impingement, and compensatory patterns that limit performance and accelerate wear.
        </p>
        <p class="epc-blog-text">
          The good news? Most squat dysfunction is correctable. With the right understanding of mechanics, targeted mobility work, and intelligent programming, you can restore this foundational pattern and protect your joints for life.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="epc-blog-section">
        <h2 class="epc-section-title">What Makes a Good Squat?</h2>
        <p class="epc-blog-text">
          A proper squat is a coordinated movement involving the ankles, knees, hips, and spine. When done correctly, force distributes evenly across these joints, allowing you to move heavy loads safely and efficiently.
        </p>
        <div class="epc-example">
          <strong>The non-negotiables:</strong> Neutral spine position, knees tracking over toes, weight distributed through the full foot, hips descending back and down, and the ability to maintain tension throughout the entire range of motion.
        </div>
        <p class="epc-blog-text">
          A quality squat should feel stable, controlled, and relatively effortless in the positions your body can access. If you're fighting to stay upright, your knees are caving in, or you're compensating with excessive forward lean, something in the system needs attention.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="epc-blog-section">
        <h2 class="epc-section-title">The Mechanics: Breaking Down the Movement</h2>
        
        <p class="epc-blog-text">
          <strong>The Setup</strong><br>
          Feet should be positioned slightly wider than hip-width, with toes pointed slightly outward (10-15 degrees). This allows your femurs to clear your pelvis as you descend into the bottom position. Weight should be distributed evenly across the entire foot—not shifted to the toes or heels.
        </p>
        
        <p class="epc-blog-text">
          <strong>The Descent</strong><br>
          The movement begins with a simultaneous hip hinge and knee bend. Your hips should move back and down as your knees track forward over your toes. Your torso will naturally lean forward to maintain balance, but your spine should remain neutral—no excessive rounding or hyperextension.
        </p>
        
        <div class="epc-example">
          <strong>Key coaching cue:</strong> Think "spread the floor" with your feet as you descend. This activates your glutes and external rotators, preventing knee valgus (inward collapse) and maintaining proper joint alignment.
        </div>
        
        <p class="epc-blog-text">
          <strong>The Bottom Position</strong><br>
          In a full-depth squat, your hip crease should descend below your knee. Your spine stays neutral, your knees remain aligned over your toes, and your heels stay planted. This position requires adequate ankle dorsiflexion, hip flexion range, and thoracic extension—limitations in any of these areas will cause compensations.
        </p>
        
        <p class="epc-blog-text">
          <strong>The Ascent</strong><br>
          Drive through your entire foot, maintaining knee alignment and spinal position. Your hips and shoulders should rise at the same rate—if your hips shoot up first, you're losing tension and placing excessive stress on your lower back.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="epc-divider"></div>
      
      <div class="epc-blog-section">
        <h2 class="epc-section-title">Common Squat Breakdowns (And What They Mean)</h2>
        
        <p class="epc-blog-text">
          <strong>Knees Caving Inward (Valgus Collapse)</strong><br>
          This is one of the most common and damaging compensation patterns. When your knees collapse inward during the squat, it places enormous stress on the knee joint, ACL, and medial meniscus.
        </p>
        
        <div class="epc-example">
          <strong>Why it happens:</strong> Weak glutes (especially glute medius), poor hip external rotation control, or limited ankle mobility forcing the knees to compensate. In some cases, it's simply a learned motor pattern that needs retraining.
        </div>
        
        <p class="epc-blog-text">
          <strong>Excessive Forward Lean</strong><br>
          If your torso is nearly parallel to the ground at the bottom of your squat, something isn't moving properly. This pattern overloads the lower back and reduces force production from your glutes and quads.
        </p>
        
        <div class="epc-example">
          <strong>Why it happens:</strong> Limited ankle dorsiflexion is the most common culprit. When your ankle can't flex forward, your body compensates by hinging excessively at the hips. Tight calves, previous ankle injuries, or structural restrictions can all contribute.
        </div>
        
        <p class="epc-blog-text">
          <strong>Heels Lifting Off the Ground</strong><br>
          If your heels come off the floor, you're shifting weight onto your toes and losing stability. This places excessive stress on the knees and makes it nearly impossible to recruit your posterior chain effectively.
        </p>
        
        <div class="epc-example">
          <strong>Why it happens:</strong> Again, limited ankle mobility is usually the issue. Short/stiff calves, previous ankle sprains, or wearing shoes with poor heel support can all contribute to this pattern.
        </div>
        
        <p class="epc-blog-text">
          <strong>Lumbar Flexion (Butt Wink)</strong><br>
          When your lower back rounds at the bottom of the squat, it's called "butt wink." This places shear stress on the lumbar spine and increases injury risk, especially under load.
        </p>
        
        <div class="epc-example">
          <strong>Why it happens:</strong> Limited hip flexion mobility, tight hamstrings, or poor core control. Your pelvis runs out of range and has to "borrow" motion from the lumbar spine to achieve depth.
        </div>
        
        <p class="epc-blog-text">
          <strong>Weight Shifting to One Side</strong><br>
          If you notice yourself leaning to one side or feeling more weight on one leg, you have an asymmetry that needs to be addressed before it becomes a chronic issue.
        </p>
        
        <div class="epc-example">
          <strong>Why it happens:</strong> Previous injury, hip mobility asymmetry, unilateral weakness, or motor control imbalances. This pattern accelerates uneven joint wear and often leads to pain on the "working" side.
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="epc-divider"></div>
      
      <div class="epc-blog-section">
        <h2 class="epc-section-title">How to Fix Your Squat</h2>
        
        <p class="epc-blog-text">
          Fixing a broken squat pattern requires a systematic approach: identify the limitation, address the underlying mobility or stability issue, and retrain the movement pattern under progressively increasing load.
        </p>
        
        <p class="epc-blog-text">
          <strong>Step 1: Assess Your Mobility</strong><br>
          Before you can squat well, you need adequate range of motion in your ankles, hips, and thoracic spine. A qualified clinician can assess these areas and identify restrictions that need to be addressed through manual therapy, stretching, or targeted mobility work.
        </p>
        
        <p class="epc-blog-text">
          <strong>Step 2: Build Stability Where It's Lacking</strong><br>
          Mobility without stability is useless. Once you have the range of motion, you need the strength and control to use it safely. This typically means strengthening your glutes, core, and hip external rotators.
        </p>
        
        <div class="epc-example">
          <strong>The EPC approach:</strong> We use targeted exercises like banded clamshells, single-leg deadlifts, and anti-rotation holds to build stability in the positions where your squat breaks down. Then we integrate that stability back into the squat pattern itself.
        </div>
        
        <p class="epc-blog-text">
          <strong>Step 3: Retrain the Pattern</strong><br>
          Once mobility and stability are addressed, it's time to relearn the movement. Start with bodyweight squats, focusing on perfect mechanics. Use tempo work (slow eccentric, pause at bottom) to build control. Gradually add load only when the pattern is clean.
        </p>
        
        <p class="epc-blog-text">
          <strong>Step 4: Load Progressively and Maintain</strong><br>
          As your squat improves, you can begin loading the pattern with barbells, dumbbells, or other implements. The key is maintaining quality mechanics under fatigue. If your form breaks down, reduce the load or volume—compensatory patterns under load accelerate injury.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="epc-highlight-box">
        <h3>Corrective Exercises for Common Squat Issues</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>For knee valgus:</strong> Banded lateral walks, clamshells, and single-leg glute bridges to strengthen hip abduction and external rotation</li>
          <li><strong>For limited ankle mobility:</strong> Ankle mobility drills with a band, eccentric calf work, and manual joint mobilizations</li>
          <li><strong>For excessive forward lean:</strong> Goblet squats, front squats, and elevated heel work to improve upright positioning</li>
          <li><strong>For butt wink:</strong> Hip flexor stretches, 90/90 hip mobility work, and dead bug variations for core control</li>
          <li><strong>For asymmetries:</strong> Single-leg exercises, unilateral loading patterns, and focused mobility work on the restricted side</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="epc-blog-section">
        <h2 class="epc-section-title">Squat Variations for Different Goals</h2>
        
        <p class="epc-blog-text">
          Not all squats are created equal. Different variations emphasize different muscle groups and movement qualities. Understanding when to use each variation is key to building a balanced, resilient body.
        </p>
        
        <p class="epc-blog-text">
          <strong>Back Squat:</strong> The king of lower body strength development. Loads the posterior chain heavily and allows for maximal load. Requires good thoracic mobility and shoulder external rotation to hold the bar safely.
        </p>
        
        <p class="epc-blog-text">
          <strong>Front Squat:</strong> Forces a more upright torso position, emphasizing the quads and core. Excellent for improving posture and thoracic extension. Often easier on the lower back than back squats.
        </p>
        
        <p class="epc-blog-text">
          <strong>Goblet Squat:</strong> The best teaching tool for learning proper squat mechanics. The anterior load naturally encourages an upright torso and proper weight distribution. Perfect for beginners or during corrective phases.
        </p>
        
        <p class="epc-blog-text">
          <strong>Split Squat / Bulgarian Split Squat:</strong> Unilateral variations that expose and correct asymmetries. Excellent for knee health, hip stability, and functional strength. Lower spinal loading makes them ideal during rehab.
        </p>

      <div class="epc-divider"></div>
      
      <div class="epc-blog-section">
        <h2 class="epc-section-title">The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p class="epc-blog-text">
          Your squat is more than a gym exercise—it's a window into how well your body moves and how resilient you'll be as you age. A strong, pain-free squat protects your knees, strengthens your hips, stabilizes your spine, and maintains your independence for life.

          At Elite Performance Clinic, we don't just teach you to squat—we assess your individual limitations, correct the underlying issues, and build a movement pattern that supports your performance and longevity. Whether you're rehabbing an injury, optimizing athletic output, or simply want to move better for decades to come, mastering the squat is non-negotiable.
