📁 PLACE YOUR GLB FILE HERE

1. Name your GLB file: journal.glb
2. Place it in this directory: /Users/sarahkitay/Desktop/epc-static/assets/svg/journal.glb
3. The 3D loader will automatically load it from: /assets/svg/journal.glb

GLB Requirements:
- GLB is a binary 3D model format (glTF 2.0)
- Works perfectly with Three.js GLTFLoader
- Can include textures, materials, and animations
- Much better for 3D than SVG!

Once you place the file, the 3D figure will appear in the center of the spiral journal!

The model will:
- Rotate based on scroll position
- Be centered automatically
- Scale to fit the container
- Have orbiting journal blocks around it
